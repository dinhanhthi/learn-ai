# 📝 Google articles for understanding concepts

Below are the collection of articles / blog posts / videos which are useful (and intuitive) to understanding concepts / algorithms in Machine Learning and Data Science. In the time of collecting, the URLs are fine but I don't guarantee for their existence after that.

The articles are grouped by subjects and alphabet orders.
